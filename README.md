# The Joy of ProcessWire

We enjoy working and making fun projects with the amazing CMS/CMF [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com).
This is a place where we keep our experiments and wild ideas.
Maybe some of them could be useful to you and that would be awesome.

## Ideas

### ☄️ [Wire Render Pattern](https://github.com/joyofpw/wire-render-pattern) 

Instead of using external template systems. 
Maybe using the native `wireRenderFile()` function 
would be enough for simple and complex projects.

### 🈴 [Better Translatable Strings](https://github.com/joyofpw/better-translatable-strings)

Discover how using the `wirePopulateStringTags()` function can improve tremendously the translation strings.
And helps with the translation process.

### 🚎 [SolidWire Pseudo Language](https://github.com/joyofpw/solidwire)

When you need to prototype different ideas.
Using the *SolidWire* language could help you clear your vision. 
Represent different relationships between *templates, fields and pages*
in a standarized way. Communicate better and faster by following sane conventions.
